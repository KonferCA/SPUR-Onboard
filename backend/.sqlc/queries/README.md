# Queries

Queries are just normal SQL files. Refer to https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/stable/tutorials/getting-started-postgresql.html for more information.

Queries files can't be in nested folders. To organize the queries, group all actions/queries for a table in one SQL file with the naming
scheme `$tablename_queries.sql`.
